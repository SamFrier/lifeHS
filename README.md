# lifeHS
Simple implementation of [Conway's Game of Life][1] in Haskell using a finite grid.

## Getting Started

First compile using GHC: `ghc --make life`

Then run the binary file: `./life [optional input file]`. The game will run indefinitely until you terminate it using e.g. Ctrl-C.

The starting state of the game is taken from the contents of a text file specified as a command line argument, or `default.txt` if none is specified. When writing an input file, use `#` to denote alive cells and `.` to denote dead cells. (Also, make sure the grid is a perfect rectangle!) For example, here is a 10x10 grid containing a single 'glider':

    ..........
    ..........
    ...#......
    ....#.....
    ..###.....
